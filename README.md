Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
My name is Szczepan and I am a programming enthusiast with a passion for learning and improving my skills.
I am currently learning Python and am excited to apply my skills in a professional setting. In addition to programming, I am also interested in history and sports.
Thank you for visiting my profile. I look forward to connecting with others in the industry and exploring internship or job opportunities.
Please feel free to take a look at my repositories and reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
